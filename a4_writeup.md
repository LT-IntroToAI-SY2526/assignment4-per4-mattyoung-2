# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The hardest part of this was not the game structure itself it was allowing it to detect a win or loss. It was also hard to map out the list of the tic tac toe game. 


2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I think I could add a computer player to the game by creating a player function that interacts with the tic tac toe board.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I would maybe want to make the computer player try every possible move it can make, and have that code written and also have the ability to predict future moves from oppenent player. I think ou can code it and program it to know the right move to make every single time.
